Source code for the Arma 3 mod @bafops2.

Each directory under addons needs to be built into a .pbo by AddonBuilder or similar and signed (.biprivatekey not included in this repository for obvious reasons...)

Function files are named "fn_functionName.sqf" and translate to 'bafops2_fnc_functionName'
